# Campaign Switcher

When viewing a campaign, the campaign's name is clickable in the top of the sidebar. This opens up the campaign switcher.

First it shows campaigns you are a member of, followed by campaigns you are following.

The last option is to create a new campaign.

## Changing the order

By default, campaigns appear in the order of you joining/following them. This can be change in your [appearance settings](https://app.kanka.io/settings/appearance). The option is called **Campaign switcher default order**.
