# Vanity URL

Premium campaigns can set a vanity url for their campaign, which will appear in the URL of every page of the campaign.

Once set, the vanity url cannot be removed, but stays even if the campaign is no longer premium.

The Kanka team monitors vanity urls and will disable those who break the Kanka terms of service.
