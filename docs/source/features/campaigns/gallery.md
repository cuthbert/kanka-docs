# Gallery

Every campaign has access to a gallery, a place to upload and re-use images throughout the campaign.

By default, free campaigns are limited to **50** (fifty) MB of images, while premium campaigns get up to **1** (one) GB.

Only members of the campaign's **admin** role, or members in a role which has the **gallery** permission can access the whole gallery from the sidebar. Others can simply select images from the gallery, or upload to it from the text editor.
